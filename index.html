        <h3 class="sub-title">Hackathons</h3>
        <p class="sub-text">
          <b>MontyHacks | Recycle It | 1st Place</b> Our team consisted of a total of 3 members, and we worked together to create a mobile application written in Flutter and a machine learning model that uses Tensorflow and OpenCV. The theme of this hackathon was sustainability and this application intends to incentivize the process of recycling by providing tax benefits. When people throw a recyclable item into their recycling bin, it is taken by the recycling truck and analyzed with our machine learning database, which then reports the information about the item recycled and the tax benefits back to the Flutter application through Firebase. The Flutter application reports global data of all the users using Recycle It and compares it to one's own data. Additionally, users can report that they have bought a recyclable item so that the ratio between recycled items bought and recycled items recorded by the recycling truck can be compared. Under the tax benefits section, users can view their total tax deduction and how many items they recycled. The application was deployed to mobile, web, and desktop. After hours of hard work, our team received the 1st place prize.

          <b>Tech Stack:</b> Tensorflow, OpenCV, Flutter, Firebase

          <b>UPenn HealthHacks | Healthdemic | 3rd Place</b> Created an award-winning web application, Healthdemic, at HealthHacks, and received 3rd place. The goal of this hackathon was to create a mobile or web application that could solve a healthcare problem that is widely faced today. In 36 hours, other team members and I created a web application using the MERN stack along with a few Python scripts. Healthdemic is a one-stop health buddy for use during the pandemic, and has a variety of features, including an AI fitness tracker, mental health chat bot, and AI diet recommendation. The fitness tracker keeps track of the number of reps, time spent, and calories burnt per user. Additionally, the fitness tracker supports four main exercises (push ups, crunches, squats, and bicep curls), which are tracked by computer vision using PoseNet. The next feature is the mental health chat bot that has general information about mental health issues and uses sentiment analysis to send back positive messages whenever a negative message is sent. The last feature, AI diet recommendation, takes in five parameters (weight, height, age, gender, exercise amount) and returns a personalized diet plan.

          <b>Tech stack:</b> MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, Python, Twilio API
